# PGP

My email address is hosted by Proton Mail. If you already have or create a Proton account, we can communicate end-to-end encrypted. It's free to register and you don't need to give them - or me - any personal data.

If you want to encrypt your emails to me with other providers, you can use my PGP public key (fingerprint: 9CAE C7B9 DC2C A98F 67A0 F307 77E4 EDB3 5B67 ABBD).
